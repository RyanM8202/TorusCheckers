# Torus Checkers

Play Checkers on a Torus. This implies that there are no longer kings, pieces just continue around the board.

### Instructions
On your turn (Black goes first) click to select a checker of your color. Then click where you want to move it.
* If you move a checker, deselecting the checker ends your turn.
* If you deselect a checker without moving it, you can change your selection.

### What does it mean to be on a torus?
A torus is the geometric name for the shape of a donut. As it applies here, the essential part is that a plane can be folded into a torus by connecting its opposite edges, top to bottom and side to side.

The shape itself is not important - the only important part is what this means for how your pieces move.
* Any piece can move off of one side of the board and enter on the other side of the board, as if these two sides were connected.
* In the original game of checkers, a piece that advances to the far side of the board would become stuck if not for 'crowning' the piece. On a torus, a piece cannot be stuck at the far side of the board, as that piece can simply advance further and end up back around the front. Therefore there is no crowning, only movement forward.

### End of Game
I make no guarantees that the game will end in anything but a perpetual stalemate, as your pieces and your opponents could avoid each other on a torus forever. It could be that with some advance planning you avoid that situation, but that is on you. Good luck!
